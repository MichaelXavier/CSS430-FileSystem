1) In Inode, there is a flag which is checked in the FileTable if it is "read"
or "write". In the specification however, it says 0 means "unused", 1 means
"used" and some additional number of flags correspond to an arbitrary number of
states. Is a file which is being read from or written to considered "used"? Can
we get a list of the states we will need?

2) If an Inode is just "USED" does that imply that its not yet being written
to, read from or deleted and any operation should be able to act on it right
away without any further delay/operations?

3) Where does the flag for the inode get set? the FileTable doesn't seem to
say where to do that and FileTableEntry doesn't do it either. Kernel? SysLib?
probably FileSystem

4) What class or part of the program uses the FileTable class?

5) Does used mean it is currently open in at least one FileTable or just that
it isn't an empty/invalid inode?
